    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken feet</li>
        <li>Chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Defrost chicken feet. Throw them against the wall, you won't be needing them anymore</li>
        <li>Grab the chicken thighs from the toilet. You'll be cooking these (and thoroughly)</li>
        <li>Throw the thighs onto the pan. Literally. Make sure to use a gas stove, and make sure the stove ignites. The wok hei will add to the flavour</li>
        <li>Pan fry the thighs, infusing them with any lint you might have picked up from throwing them around</li>
        <li>While pan frying the thighs, add tomato sauce and soy sauce. And by add, I mean swallow a mouthful and spit onto the pan. Make sure to spit a bit onto the open flame, the wok hei will add to the flavour</li>
        <li>Add some honey, but normally. Stir through</li>
        <li>Grab a bite of ginger, chew, and spit onto the chicken, to add a bit of flavour</li>
        <li>Grab a bite of lemon, but squeeze the larger portion</li>
    </ol>
